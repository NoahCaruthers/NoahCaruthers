- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    -  It is important to be accesible to the end user. I think that it helps to ask the user questions about what kind of functions and implementaions that they want in a program.
     The user stories are used to show the team how I would interpret the users needs.
- How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    -  I hope that I will use the open communications a lot in my develpopment career. I like that agile practices a team work environment and makes each person feel included in a project. 
- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    -  It means that not only do you do your part, but that you help others and ask questions when you do not understand something. Nothing hurts a team more than someone not understanding something
    and not saying anything or not getting the help that they need.

- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    -  For this project, I was tasked to discover sofware requirements and potential design constraints. I was then made to compare and contrast between four of the traditional OS from server side, client side, and developments tools. Based on all of this I had to make recommendations for the operating plaform, OS architectures, storage management, memory management, Distributed Systems and Networks, and security.
- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    -  I was able to answer each of the questions asked in completion and consicely so that people could read it without coming from a computer science background.
- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    -  I think that this challenged me to think about why I was writing the code for reasons that I would not typically think of.    
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    -  I would redo my Evaluation section because I think there is some detail that I was not able to provide as well as I would have liked.
- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    -  I was able to make sure that the software was going to be produced at a low cost while also maintaining the importance of functionality.. This is important becuase it allows the client to get the most of a service that they are paying for.
- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
    -  The most important thing to me was making sure that I was adressing the clients needs and also trying to identify other potential needs of the client. I think that this will be very helpful to me in my future.
