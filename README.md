-   How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    -  It is important to be accesible to the end user. I think that it helps to ask the user questions about what kind of functions and implementaions that they want in a program.
     The user stories are used to show the team how I would interpret the users needs.
- How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    -  I hope that I will use the open communications a lot in my develpopment career. I like that agile practices a team work environment and makes each person feel included in a project. 
- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    -  It means that not only do you do your part, but that you help others and ask questions when you do not understand something. Nothing hurts a team more than someone not understanding something
    and not saying anything or not getting the help that they need.
